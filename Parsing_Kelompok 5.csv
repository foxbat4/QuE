    If you were looking for a cream, do not get this it will not compare. I have been using creams for almost a year and lotions do not cut it.On the other hand, this is a high-quality lotion. I will save it for my family to use if they will use it I’m not sure if they have sensitive skin or not, but it is a nice lotion to use. It doesn’t have any of the ingredients that are usually added to most lotions Just all the good stuff. Leaving you with smooth, moist soft skin.!

    As someone who grew up in humid climate. I have have hated every lotion I’ve ever used. They have either left me feeling greasy or have not been well absorbed and feel nasty when I sweat. This is the first time I can say that a lotion feels lightweight and is absorbed quickly but is lasting. It doesn’t “feel” like I have lotion on during they day even though my skin looks and feels hydrated and doesn’t get greasy when I sweat. 10/10 highly recommend.

    I am a mid-thirties male, and I purchased this mostly because I wanted a simple, non-greasy moisturizes for days when my skin - mostly my arms - are a bit dry. My skin is naturally oily, so this is only the case when the weather or work conditions turn against me. CeraVe has proved adequate to the task, though it is still just a little oily in that I can feel it on the skin after it has dried, or been absorbed, or whatever it does.As anyone can see, the moisturizer market is enormous and diverse beyond measure, and I didn't want to get into a long process of research to find the best one. Nor did I want a moisturizer marketed just for men or one which needs to be paired with three other products to be effective, or has a place in a lengthy twice-a-day skincare routine. I just wanted a simple, relatively inexpensive lotion for occasional use.This works well enough. You get plenty in the bottle, it moistens dry skin, it doesn't have a particularly notable smell. It isn't oily, but I can still sort of feel it on my skin even after it has been 20m, so I may need to look at least a little further to find something that isn't like that, but this sufficient for my purposes.If your interest in the same as mine, I'd recommend it.

    Okay the description is a bit misleading because it says for your whole body including face.It is rather runny and absorbs rather slowly so I wouldn’t advise applying it on your face.Other than that, you should expect good quality from the brand.

    My skin gets so dry and irritated after I shave my legs that I crave using this Cerave lotion. A little goes a long way! It just takes one pump to cover my calf and another for my thigh. The lotion is thin and glides on very fast. I don't feel sticky or greasy after. My itchiness goes away almost instantly when using this lotion.For best results, I recommend using this all-over fresh out of the shower to help lock in moisture.I also use this as my daily face lotion in the summer.

    Received a travel size CeraVe moisturizing cream in a travel kit and LOVED it! Wanted some by my kitchen and bathroom sinks for the convenience. Shopped for a dispenser first, then realized the cream probably wouldn't pump correctly without being diluted (and what's the point in that) so found this lotion version to use. Works great in the dispenser, and I love how this lotion absorbs readily, is NOT scented, and isn't oily. The only complaint I have is that for me, living in the desert where it's often in single-digit humidity, I need to reapply it fairly often. I do prefer the cream version (slightly different ingredients) because, even though it too absorbs/isn't scented/isn't oily, it lasts much longer. I imagine I'll go through the cream more quickly than the daily lotion.

    I'm newer to actually using lotion, and was unsure what to buy.  I took a chance on this as it was one of the recommended ones that came across my list.  Now that I'm a few months in, and on my 2nd bottle, I can honestly say that I'm impressed.  I didn't realize the difference that lotion would make when used regularly.  It has been a bit of a learning process to figure out the correct amount to use.  I've found that a little goes a lot further than I thought it would.  My skin is so much smoother now and stays that way throughout the day.  It lasts well into the next day.  This has also been a life saver on the few occasions where my hands and knuckles have dried out and started to crack from the amount of hand washing I have to do.  A bit of this before bed, and by the next morning there is a noticeable difference and the top of my hands no longer burn.  Great product, I'll be placing my third order here very soon :)

    As the title states, I up until recently had been using my tried and true lotion for years but I began to notice the skin on my arms were starting to look crepey. I never considered that age was doing this to me. It forced me to find another product that helped with locking in moisture and so after reading many reviews for different lotions I decided to try CeraVe.I have been using it consistently now for about 3 weeks both morning and before bed and the difference is very noticeable. I love that the lotion isn't greasy and really absorbs especially at night as I don't relish the idea of going to bed with greasy skin and getting it all over my sheets. It's fragrance free as well which is nice. Thumbs up for this lotion.

    Great moisturizer for all skin types! I was afraid that if i use lotion on my face, it would make my naturally oily skin even more oily. While it was true for the first 2 weeks of using the product (user error), I have learned how much product to apply each time. I am new to the face care routine so it was a small learning curve. After using their face wash, I apply about a half dime size to my fingers and spread across my face. I find this is the perfect amount for me that does not make my skin feel greasy after application. Putting just enough for the skin to absorb but not to saturate is what i found works best for my oily skin. Honestly, my skin looks the same after 4 months but at least its not getting worse? lol

    While on vacation with my family, my sister 'n law mentioned that she uses CeraVe Daily moisturizer and cream. She admitted she did not bring it with her and had me feel just how soft her hands still were after not having used it for a few days.  Right then and there, I jumped on Amazon and ordered both the moisturizer and the cream!  Wow!

CeraVe is the only skin cream for me!

    While on vacation with my family, my sister 'n law mentioned that she uses CeraVe Daily moisturizer and cream. She admitted she did not bring it with her and had me feel just how soft her hands still were after not having used it for a few days.  Right then and there, I jumped on Amazon and ordered both the moisturizer and the cream!  Wow!  They do not advertise this as a antiaging cream, however the difference in my skin after only a few days, AMAZING!  I wish I could bathe in it!  I will never use another cream or moisturizer again!  CeraVe is the only skin cream for me!

5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Daily Moisturizer for Dry Skin!,"I’ve been using the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for more than 6 months now and I’m really liking it. I have dry skin but this fragrance free, oil free lotion is so gentle and controlled in its moisturizing. It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue behind – big plus.

It’s also got hyaluronic acid and ceramides in it which help lock in moisture and fortify the skin’s natural barrier. The MVE technology seems to work too, my skin feels comfortable and hydrated all day.

Also it’s been accepted by the National Eczema Association so it’s good for sensitive skin concerns. Overall I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fragrance free moisturizer for dry skin. At this price , I think it’s a steal!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great lotion for those with sensitive skin,"Moisturizes well and helps with dry skin. Gentle enough to use on face. Hard to find quality, non-irritating fragrance free lotions, but this works wonders!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The Ultimate Solution for Dry Skin Woes!,"If you're like me and have been battling relentless dry skin, especially during the harsh winter months, then you'll understand the struggle of finding the perfect moisturizer. Enter CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion – a game-changer in the realm of skincare.

I recently found myself in dire need of a solution to combat my dry skin, particularly on my face. I had tried countless products, only to be disappointed by their thick consistency that refused to blend seamlessly into my skin, leaving residue in my beard and an unpleasant oily film on my hands. That's when I stumbled upon CeraVe, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer.

First and foremost, let's talk about texture. The CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion boasts a lightweight and silky-smooth texture that glides effortlessly onto the skin. Gone are the days of struggling to rub in thick, stubborn creams – this lotion absorbs quickly and easily, leaving behind no residue or oily feeling. It's a breath of fresh air for anyone tired of dealing with greasy, heavy moisturizers.

One of my favorite things about this lotion is its beard-friendly nature. Unlike other products that would stubbornly cling to my short beard, leaving it feeling greasy and weighed down, the CeraVe lotion effortlessly absorbs into the skin without a trace. No more worrying about product buildup or an unkempt appearance – just smooth, hydrated skin, even in the most stubborn areas.

But the real magic of CeraVe lies in its effectiveness. Not only does it provide instant relief from dry, irritated skin, but it also delivers long-lasting hydration that keeps my skin feeling soft and supple throughout the day. Paired with the CeraVe nighttime moisturizer, it's a dynamic duo that ensures my skin stays hydrated and healthy around the clock.

In conclusion, the CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a skincare savior for anyone struggling with dry, irritated skin. Its lightweight texture, beard-friendly formula, and unmatched hydration make it a must-have in any skincare routine. Say goodbye to dry skin woes and hello to smooth, nourished skin with CeraVe"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Staple skincare!,"This is a no frills moisturizer. It’s just a staple for me at this point and lasts forever.

My skin is noticeably softer and more supple the morning I wake up after applying at night. This really does lock in moisture.

Thinner consistency and non greasy so it’s great for daytime too. I think people who hate thick moisturizers will love this."
4.0 out of 5 stars,A simply daily moisturizer,"I am a mid-thirties male, and I purchased this mostly because I wanted a simple, non-greasy moisturizes for days when my skin - mostly my arms - are a bit dry. My skin is naturally oily, so this is only the case when the weather or work conditions turn against me. CeraVe has proved adequate to the task, though it is still just a little oily in that I can feel it on the skin after it has dried, or been absorbed, or whatever it does.

As anyone can see, the moisturizer market is enormous and diverse beyond measure, and I didn't want to get into a long process of research to find the best one. Nor did I want a moisturizer marketed just for men or one which needs to be paired with three other products to be effective, or has a place in a lengthy twice-a-day skincare routine. I just wanted a simple, relatively inexpensive lotion for occasional use.

This works well enough. You get plenty in the bottle, it moistens dry skin, it doesn't have a particularly notable smell. It isn't oily, but I can still sort of feel it on my skin even after it has been 20m, so I may need to look at least a little further to find something that isn't like that, but this sufficient for my purposes.

If your interest in the same as mine, I'd recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Lotion EVER!!,"CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion has become my go-to for dry skin! With my extremely sensitive skin, I often struggle to find moisturizers that don’t cause irritation, but this lotion works perfectly. It provides long-lasting hydration without feeling greasy, and the hyaluronic acid gives my skin an extra moisture boost. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. I’m thrilled that it’s gentle enough for both my face and body. I can’t recommend it enough—definitely a five-star product!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice body lotion for everyday use,"I am using this body lotion on regular basis but  still ,i don't have any alergic reaction on my skin.This lotion is not greesy and after apply on skin it will become smooth and hydrated.Nice body lotion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a must-have for anyone seeking deep, long-lasting moisture. It's lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and hydrated all day. Perfect for sensitive skin, this cream has become an essential part of my skincare routine. Highly recommended!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied customer,"I bought this product because it's touted as a moisturizer that works just as well for your face as for your body, plus the multiple rave reviews. Thus far, I've been pretty happy with it. It absorbs nicely into my facial complexion without a 'heavy' greasy feeling, and on my arms it leaves it feeling a lot softer than without. I also wanted to use it an an unscented 'base' to allow my colognes to last longer on me, but I haven't confirmed whether it makes a measurable difference in that regard."
5.0 out of 5 stars,CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion,"I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT (Please reference my Assessment of CeraVe Foaming Oil Cleanser) BOTH PRODUCTS are large size; great value for money.

This lotion is lightweight; small amount goes a long way; application to skin dries rapidly (put on face and body after getting out of shower while pores are opened - this effectively moisturizes hydrating skin). It doesn’t have any perfume in it. So, if your preference is this,
you won’t like this lotion!"
,,
5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing your skin all day,"Perfect skin care product after you get out the shower/bath or whenever. Keeps your skin tone and appearance looking hydrated and moist all day, not oily at all. I use it everyday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,It's good for mild dryness,"I wouldn't recommend this product to someone that has moderate to severely dry skin. If you are someone who doesn't like the heaviness of product and just looking for a nice, shear feel.. this is a great product for you. For someone who needs more thickness, I recommend ""Cerave-SA"" cream."
5.0 out of 5 stars,A great moisturizer,I got well moisturized skin all throughout the day when I used it. And it didn't irritate my skin. I love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Great! And great!,"I’ve found my holy grail product! It absorbs quickly into my skin, so it doesn’t interfere with makeup, yet it keeps my skin hydrated all day. Of course, it works great on my body too. This is my go-to lotion from now on!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Moisturizing lotion,"I love this lotion. It's makes the skin fresh, clean, soft & it's thickness is great. I use it on my face too.👍feels cool."
5.0 out of 5 stars,moisturizer,this is amazing. It has made a huge difference in my skin compared to the other product I was using.
4.0 out of 5 stars,This is definitely a moisturizing lotion and not a cream,"If you were looking for a cream, do not get this it will not compare. I have been using creams for almost a year and lotions do not cut it.
On the other hand, this is a high-quality lotion. I will save it for my family to use if they will use it I’m not sure if they have sensitive skin or not, but it is a nice lotion to use. It doesn’t have any of the ingredients that are usually added to most lotions Just all the good stuff. Leaving you with smooth, moist soft skin.!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,effective & very fast absorbing,i think this is about the best body moisturizer i have ever used. it gets absorbed very quickly. it does not feel greasy or gooey on your skin. love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It works I have very dry skin !,This is a great lotion for extra dry itchy skin! Our water here isn’t very good so my skin needs lots of moisture and balance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,CERAVE LOTION,I love this lotion. It really smooth your skin and takes away the dryness.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good lotion,"Good lotion, but waste a lot with pump"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent lotion,"I love this lotion. I always buy it however, I started ordering it since it was a little cheaper to me on amazon."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent moisturize, doesn't absorb","It keeps my face glowing and moisturized all day, but it doesn't absorb into skin, even after many hours. So doesn't work great with makeup, but is great for no-makeup days or as a body lotion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Daughter's favourite,Great to have available in large sizes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,"My diabetic feet get so dry and uncomfortable. This lotion is great. Not sticky, even when sweating. Make my feet feel normal again and lasts all day or night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best moisturizer,Works well was recommended by my Dermatologist after a light treatment and I like it 😀
5.0 out of 5 stars,It was not greasy,Thos product is great for me in warm and cold weather.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good moisturizer,"Love this moisturizer, however it is not for oily skin. I have combination skin so it works well for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Mom loves it,Bought this for my mom and she loves it
5.0 out of 5 stars,The only lotion my family uses,"As a family with sensitive skin, this is the only brand we use. We have this bad boy on auto ship so we never run out!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good on body, not on face!","Okay the description is a bit misleading because it says for your whole body including face.

It is rather runny and absorbs rather slowly so I wouldn’t advise applying it on your face.

Other than that, you should expect good quality from the brand. I used to have dry and rough skin but now it feels a lot smoother."
4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Hydration but Falls Short on Long-lasting Moisture,"The CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a good option for those looking for a lightweight and non-greasy moisturizer. It does a great job of hydrating the skin without being too oily or thick, which is especially beneficial for those with sensitive skin. The fact that it's fragrance-free is another big plus. However, I found that the hydration doesn't last as long as I would like, requiring reapplication throughout the day. While it's a good lotion, I wish it provided longer-lasting moisture."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!,I have only been using this for a few days now and my skin is looking a lot better!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Itchy redness relief,"My skin gets so dry and irritated after I shave my legs that I crave using this Cerave lotion. A little goes a long way! It just takes one pump to cover my calf and another for my thigh. The lotion is thin and glides on very fast. I don't feel sticky or greasy after. My itchiness goes away almost instantly when using this lotion.

For best results, I recommend using this all-over fresh out of the shower to help lock in moisture.

I also use this as my daily face lotion in the summer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Always so good,My top moisturizer for the summer. Its lightweight and moisturizing. Really good for a hot day when you just want something light on your face. I just use a cleanser and moisturize with this on damp skin. Tewwww good!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for sensitive skin,This has been a lifesaver for my sensitive skin. I really noticed a difference right away. Nice big bottle too.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Makes my skin soft,Great size for the price and leaves my skin soft!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,Good product
4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s just hard tell whether it works,"I purchased this with other products for whitening my skin. The good part is that the hydration makes a smooth feeling, but it does not works for a long lasting period of time. You have to put a big amount to keep skin moisture."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Was bought for my son,He loves this product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,So good,This stuff is amazing. I bought it for my hands feet and legs but I use it on my face more than anything else. I have tried so many products and they all break out my dry skin or don’t moisturize at all. This product I can use many times a day without break outs. The more I use it the more my skin looks plumped up and my wrinkles are less noticeable.
5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,CeraVe is the G.O.A.T. Perfect for all of my skin needs from head to toe.
4.0 out of 5 stars,My go to lotion,"I use this on my face as well. I like this bc it’s not as oily. Used to use cetaphil and they changed their ingredients and now it’s so oily. Luckily Cera ve is still light and the stickiness goes away fairly quickly.
Please don’t change anything!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Product quality,The moothness it’s very good
4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good but not Perfect,I have been using the cream for several months and absolutely love it. I decided to try the lotion.  It is very lightweight. I wasn’t very impressed. I had purchased the serum also. When you use the two together it works a lot better. I’m not sure yet if I’ll purchase these again. I have already purchased another cream. Love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"It's the best moisturizer I have ever found and I'm 27 years old! Has helped so much keeping my face hydrated and breakout free!! Get it, no doubt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommended by my dermatologist,"I really like this product. I live in a very dry environment and this keeps my skin moisturized better than anything I have tried. I asked my dermatologist for a good moisturizer, and this is what he recommended"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Works great.  Doesn’t feel heavy or greasy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality,I LOVE CeraVe got a few of their products and wow they feel nice on the skin. No weird feeling left after you apply it and light on the skin. Pump works great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Lotion Ever,"I suddenly developed an oily skin issue. Idk how or why this happened, but it has become a challenge for me to find a skin lotion that does not exacerbate the problem. I read that this lotion is not heavy AND it repairs the skin's barrier.

This is the only lotion I use on my body now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,I use every AM & PM after washing my face and it is great!
5.0 out of 5 stars,medicated body lotion,"it's not greasy, is what my dermatologist prescribed, meets my budget and needs"
5.0 out of 5 stars,For all types of skin!,This is an excellent product for all skin types. I have an oily and sensitive skin and usually get irritated by different products but the cerave moisturising cream works great for me!

This one is great not too thick and feels awesome after applying"
4.0 out of 5 stars,It's decent,This product does not have enough oil in it. I don't know if they usually put oil in moisturizer but it's missing something. My face does not have a glow after using this product. My face appears to be dry.

5.0 out of 5 stars,Softens and doesn't stink!,It really made my skin feel great and not feel like I was hosed down with oil.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good moisturizer,Really moisturizes my face. I use it for night. Good quality. Kinda thicker than I expected but for night moisturizer it's great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Lives up to the good reviews,"I was skeptical because this is not very ""glamorous"" for a face cream, but the reviews interested me so I initially bought a small travel tube. Liked it, but still skeptical so I googled websites that evaluated the ingredients and that came out reassuringly as well. Not oily, not greasy, no weird stuff in it...good product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Came just as advertised,Came perfectly. (big size). Also had a little removable plastic part that stopped the pump from being able to be pushed down which I appreciated! Will be keeping for future uses when I need to pack the lotion away.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfecto,Calidad esperada
5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I use it for dry areas like elbows and knees, it is super moisturizing and has helped me after several weeks!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,Precio calidad.,Exelente.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, fast absorbing, hydrating",As someone who grew up in humid climate. I have have hated every lotion I’ve ever used. They have either left me feeling greasy or have not been well absorbed and feel nasty when I sweat. This is the first time I can say that a lotion feels lightweight and is absorbed quickly but is lasting. It doesn’t “feel” like I have lotion on during they day even though my skin looks and feels hydrated and doesn’t get greasy when I sweat. 10/10 highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is essential!,Unscented and unbelievably excellent. This is truly an amazing product that isn’t expensive and actually works even on old skin!

I also wanted to use it an an unscented 'base' to allow my colognes to last longer on me, but I haven't confirmed whether it makes a measurable difference in that regard."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT (Please reference my Assessment of CeraVe Foaming Oil Cleanser) BOTH PRODUCTS are large size; great value for money.

This lotion is lightweight; small amount goes a long way; application to skin dries rapidly (put on face and body after getting out of shower while pores are opened - this effectively moisturizes hydrating skin). It doesn’t have any perfume in it. So, if your preference is this,
you won’t like this lotion!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect skin care product after you get out the shower/bath or whenever. Keeps your skin tone and appearance looking hydrated and moist all day, not oily at all. I use it everyday."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I wouldn't recommend this product to someone that has moderate to severely dry skin. If you are someone who doesn't like the heaviness of product and just looking for a nice, shear feel.. this is a great product for you. For someone who needs more thickness, I recommend ""Cerave-SA"" cream."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I got well moisturized skin all throughout the day when I used it. And it didn't irritate my skin. I love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this lotion. It's makes the skin fresh, clean, soft & it's thickness is great. I use it on my face too.👍feels cool."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is amazing. It has made a huge difference in my skin compared to the other product I was using.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve found my holy grail product! It absorbs quickly into my skin, so it doesn’t interfere with makeup, yet it keeps my skin hydrated all day. Of course, it works great on my body too. This is my go-to lotion from now on!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i think this is about the best body moisturizer i have ever used. it gets absorbed very quickly. it does not feel greasy or gooey on your skin. love it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"If you were looking for a cream, do not get this it will not compare. I have been using creams for almost a year and lotions do not cut it.
On the other hand, this is a high-quality lotion. I will save it for my family to use if they will use it I’m not sure if they have sensitive skin or not, but it is a nice lotion to use. It doesn’t have any of the ingredients that are usually added to most lotions Just all the good stuff. Leaving you with smooth, moist soft skin.!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a great lotion for extra dry itchy skin! Our water here isn’t very good so my skin needs lots of moisture and balance.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love this lotion. I always buy it however, I started ordering it since it was a little cheaper to me on amazon."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"It keeps my face glowing and moisturized all day, but it doesn't absorb into skin, even after many hours. So doesn't work great with makeup, but is great for no-makeup days or as a body lotion."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great to have available in large sizes.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well was recommended by my Dermatologist after a light treatment and I like it 😀
5.0 out of 5 stars,Thos product is great for me in warm and cold weather.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love this moisturizer, however it is not for oily skin. I have combination skin so it works well for me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this lotion. It really smooth your skin and takes away the dryness.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this for my mom and she loves it
5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a family with sensitive skin, this is the only brand we use. We have this bad boy on auto ship so we never run out!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay the description is a bit misleading because it says for your whole body including face.

It is rather runny and absorbs rather slowly so I wouldn’t advise applying it on your face.

Other than that, you should expect good quality from the brand. I used to have dry and rough skin but now it feels a lot smoother."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"The CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion is a good option for those looking for a lightweight and non-greasy moisturizer. It does a great job of hydrating the skin without being too oily or thick, which is especially beneficial for those with sensitive skin. The fact that it's fragrance-free is another big plus. However, I found that the hydration doesn't last as long as I would like, requiring reapplication throughout the day. While it's a good lotion, I wish it provided longer-lasting moisture."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My diabetic feet get so dry and uncomfortable. This lotion is great. Not sticky, even when sweating. Make my feet feel normal again and lasts all day or night."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good lotion, but waste a lot with pump"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have only been using this for a few days now and my skin is looking a lot better!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"My skin gets so dry and irritated after I shave my legs that I crave using this Cerave lotion. A little goes a long way! It just takes one pump to cover my calf and another for my thigh. The lotion is thin and glides on very fast. I don't feel sticky or greasy after. My itchiness goes away almost instantly when using this lotion.

For best results, I recommend using this all-over fresh out of the shower to help lock in moisture.

I also use this as my daily face lotion in the summer."
5.0 out of 5 stars,My top moisturizer for the summer. Its lightweight and moisturizing. Really good for a hot day when you just want something light on your face. I just use a cleanser and moisturize with this on damp skin. Tewwww good!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This has been a lifesaver for my sensitive skin. I really noticed a difference right away. Nice big bottle too.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great size for the price and leaves my skin soft!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased this with other products for whitening my skin. The good part is that the hydration makes a smooth feeling, but it does not works for a long lasting period of time. You have to put a big amount to keep skin moisture."
5.0 out of 5 stars,He loves this product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,This stuff is amazing. I bought it for my hands feet and legs but I use it on my face more than anything else. I have tried so many products and they all break out my dry skin or don’t moisturize at all. This product I can use many times a day without break outs. The more I use it the more my skin looks plumped up and my wrinkles are less noticeable.
5.0 out of 5 stars,CeraVe is the G.O.A.T. Perfect for all of my skin needs from head to toe.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this on my face as well. I like this bc it’s not as oily. Used to use cetaphil and they changed their ingredients and now it’s so oily. Luckily Cera ve is still light and the stickiness goes away fairly quickly.
Please don’t change anything!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,The moothness it’s very good
4.0 out of 5 stars,I have been using the cream for several months and absolutely love it. I decided to try the lotion.  It is very lightweight. I wasn’t very impressed. I had purchased the serum also. When you use the two together it works a lot better. I’m not sure yet if I’ll purchase these again. I have already purchased another cream. Love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's the best moisturizer I have ever found and I'm 27 years old! Has helped so much keeping my face hydrated and breakout free!! Get it, no doubt."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like this product. I live in a very dry environment and this keeps my skin moisturized better than anything I have tried. I asked my dermatologist for a good moisturizer, and this is what he recommended"
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great.  Doesn’t feel heavy or greasy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE CeraVe got a few of their products and wow they feel nice on the skin. No weird feeling left after you apply it and light on the skin. Pump works great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I suddenly developed an oily skin issue. Idk how or why this happened, but it has become a challenge for me to find a skin lotion that does not exacerbate the problem. I read that this lotion is not heavy AND it repairs the skin's barrier.

This is the only lotion I use on my body now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I use every AM & PM after washing my face and it is great!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it's not greasy, is what my dermatologist prescribed, meets my budget and needs"
5.0 out of 5 stars,This is an excellent product for all skin types. I have an oily and sensitive skin and usually get irritated by different products but the cerave moisturising cream works great for me!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use this mainly on my hands during the day, especially during the dry winters in Tucson, AZ."

5.0 out of 5 stars,Have been using for years
5.0 out of 5 stars,"This stuff is awesome
I have tried many other moisturizers and have been let down many time
This one is great not too thick and feels awesome after applying"
4.0 out of 5 stars,This product does not have enough oil in it. I don't know if they usually put oil in moisturizer but it's missing something. My face does not have a glow after using this product. My face appears to be dry.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for moisturizing your skin all over.
4.0 out of 5 stars,Deja la pies suave
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Arrived on time, and was perfect. Will order again."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Body skin care softens skincare skin and not greasy. I basically use it on my arms , legs, and neck area.  Makes your skin feel great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for dry skin
5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good for dry hands.
5.0 out of 5 stars,It really made my skin feel great and not feel like I was hosed down with oil.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Really moisturizes my face. I use it for night. Good quality. Kinda thicker than I expected but for night moisturizer it's great.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was skeptical because this is not very ""glamorous"" for a face cream, but the reviews interested me so I initially bought a small travel tube. Liked it, but still skeptical so I googled websites that evaluated the ingredients and that came out reassuringly as well. Not oily, not greasy, no weird stuff in it...good product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,Came perfectly. (big size). Also had a little removable plastic part that stopped the pump from being able to be pushed down which I appreciated! Will be keeping for future uses when I need to pack the lotion away.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Calidad esperada
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use it for dry areas like elbows and knees, it is super moisturizing and has helped me after several weeks!"

5.0 out of 5 stars,Odorless and doesn't leave that greasy feeling!
5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well
5.0 out of 5 stars,Exelente.
5.0 out of 5 stars,As someone who grew up in humid climate. I have have hated every lotion I’ve ever used. They have either left me feeling greasy or have not been well absorbed and feel nasty when I sweat. This is the first time I can say that a lotion feels lightweight and is absorbed quickly but is lasting. It doesn’t “feel” like I have lotion on during they day even though my skin looks and feels hydrated and doesn’t get greasy when I sweat. 10/10 highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Unscented and unbelievably excellent. This is truly an amazing product that isn’t expensive and actually works even on old skin!
4.0 out of 5 stars,Me gusta mucho muy hidratante
5.0 out of 5 stars,A great daily moisturizing lotion. I always apply it on my face in the morning.
5.0 out of 5 stars,Rápida acción
5.0 out of 5 stars,I like the pump. & the lotion
